The minimum viable project is:

--> 1. Simple way to specify a hand.
--> 2. Simple rendering of the hands in text.
--> 3. Use text to describe any context (bidding, play so far, if needed).
--> 4. User enters the single card they would play (probably types it)


==== 1 Specify a bridge hand ====

A hand is an unordered list of cards.
Cards are given by strings e.g. "HA"

    Suit : "C" "D" "H" "S"
    Rank : "1" thru "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K"

Also has context.

Also has right answer.

n_cards     s_cards     e_cards     w_cards     context_text       right_answer

==== 2. Render hands ====
