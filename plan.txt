Now I have a minimum viable project, where I can show you a series of hands and you enter text to play it. Let's now:

Rank the hands.

    (1) Store hands in a database which can be continuously updated.
    (2) Assign the player a random ELO.
    (3) After each session, update the ELO of the hand.
    (4) Modify the display to show the ELO of the hand.
