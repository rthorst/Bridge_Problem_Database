Now I have a minimum viable project, where I can show you one hand and you enter text to play it. 
Let's build:


--> Show you a series of hands. 

    (1) Dataset of hands.      [add one more]
    (2) Hands load from the dataset.   [new script: session.py]. Has functions to load from database.
    (3) Function to show them one at a time.    [in session: show_hands_continuously()]
