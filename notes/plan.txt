1. Function to parse hand into cards.
    AKJ QJT9 .. . ... --< ["SA", "SK", "DQ", ...]

2. Function to validate data entry.

3. Ability to add data into the hands table.

4. Interact with the user

I have a working MVP that ranks hands and shows a set of them to a user in an interactive way.

I want more hands. How can I get those?

    Make a command line CLI to enter hands efficiently.
    Then enter all the David Bird Hands.
