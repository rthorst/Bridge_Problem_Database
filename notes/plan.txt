The user should be able to edit hands in the database.

Input :
Hand ID
Key to edit.

Enter new value for the key.

Validate it as before.


This implies I should create a function validate(key, value) which knows all my keys and validates.
It should work for editing fields in the DB and also for entering them in the first place. 
This is the key extension here.


2.
We should run in MongoDB, a json-like NoSQL database
